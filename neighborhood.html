      <h2>Highland Park</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently in the Highland Park neighborhood in St. Paul, MN. The
        neighborhood is filled with family homes and friendly people. Everyone
        here seems to love their homes and especially their gardens. You can
        always counts on walking your dog and have conversations with a handful
        of neighbors along the way. <br /><br />The many great local restaurants
        and breweries within biking distance make for some very memorable nights
        non-winter nights. Being located in Minnesota, there are also a few
        different outdoor rinks within the neighborhood to almost everybody
        spends all waking hours at. This neighorhod loves hockey and getting out
        the the neighborhood parks. After everyone is done freezing their butts
        off in the winter, neighbors all hangout again for the evening at one of
        the great restaurants. Click below to discover a restaurant
        recommendation in Highland Park!
